# Project_derating
This project is designed to sort BOM and analyze it. So far, we can sort different type of componenet into a catalog. Our next step
is able to fetch spec from company servers by using selenium. The final goal of this project is getting the desired information from spec and put them into derating report so hardware engineers don't have to do repeating and boring manually-sorting from spec.
Feel free to take a look at it if you like. 

Due to the confidential policy, we will not provide any BOM file for download but you can modified it to fit your BOM
